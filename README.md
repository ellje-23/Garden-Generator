# Garden-Generator
This project was assigned by __Dr. Catherine Welsh__. 

This program shows how three plants, 'Plant A', 'Plant B', and 'Plant C', grow according to a strange set of rules. 'Plant C' grows according to a set of rules I created. 
At the end, it draws the garden to a canvas using rectangles to represent a plant and color to represent a plant species. 

It requires _cs1graphics.py_ and _simplegraphics.py_ to run which were provided by Dr. Welsh.
